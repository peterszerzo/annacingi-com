_A bathroom at the end of a corridor or under a town square. It can be the bathroom of an airport, a club or a gas station. A variegated and transitory humanity passes through it. It is a place of passing, of waiting, a meeting place for strangers, an improvised dressing room where you can conjure, hide, let off steam. It is a den for demons, an antechamber, a threshold before a farewell or a baptism of fire. It is not a truer place than the outside, it is just another aspect of being alive; if outside one has to adhere to social norms, to a practice, to play, something is given up inside; it is an amoral space of suspension, even of great violence and nudity, a common place of the inner self where to expand the spectrum of daily action beyond limits and censorship._

_The common thread of Teatro dei Gordi’s path today is the search for a specific theatrical language, made up of movement, scores of concrete gestures, objects, clothes, masks, music, poetry, presence and encounter. In stage work they seek synaesthesia and a poetic theater capable of moving and producing living images. Pandora broadens research on the mask to question its boundaries. There is also here the papier-mâché mask, which characterized the two previous shows (Sulla Morte Senza Esagerare and Visite), but there are everyday masks as well, like a blindfold or a pair of glasses, like an expression or a face. And then there are improvised masks, impromptu and monstrous masks, to represent the dysmorphism and the desperation of hallucinations and paranoia._
