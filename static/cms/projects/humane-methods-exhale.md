_Is that dance, permanent performance, drama, biological-technological installation or a collective experiment? Probably all together. The artist group Fronte Vacuo (...) looks at people, machines and algorithms in their latest production HUMANE METHODS \[∑XHALE]. It takes place in a world in which systemic intolerance, environmental destruction and unethical technological developments have formed an all-pervasive structure of violence._
