I am a designer with roots in Reggio Emilia, Italy, working in theatre, opera, performance and installations since 2014.

I studied set design at Accademia di Brera in Milan, and I trained in stage engineering and scenic arts at Teatro alla Scala. Since then I've been moving around Europe and beyond. I am currently Milan- and Berlin-based.

I have a soft spot for puppetry, and for Bruno Schulz-quotes like this:

> ‘Do you understand \[...] the profound meaning of that weakness, that passion for gaudy tissue-paper, papier-mâché, coloured lacquer, straw, and sawdust? It is \[...] our love for matter as such, for its downiness and porousness, its unique, mystical consistency.’

Feel free to connect by [email](mailto:annamcingi@gmail.com) or [social media](https://www.instagram.com/pannacingi/) if you're interested in working with me or to learn more. Looking forward!
