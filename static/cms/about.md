I am a set, costume and prop designer with roots in Milan, working in theatre and opera since 2014.

I studied set design at Accademia di Brera in Milan, and I trained in stage engineering and scenic arts at Teatro alla Scala. I have a soft spot for puppetry, and for Bruno Schulz-quotes like this:

> ‘Do you understand [...] the profound meaning of that weakness, that passion for gaudy tissue-paper, papier-mâché, coloured lacquer, straw, and sawdust? It is [...] our love for matter as such, for its downiness and porousness, its unique, mystical consistency.’
